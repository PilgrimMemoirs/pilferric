    bio: 'Unlike most personal injury lawyers, for almost 30 years I\'ve only represented injury victims. I have tried many cases, big and small, and I\'m not afraid to go to court to get justice when insurance companies refuse to pay. I have won 7 and 8 figure settlements and verdicts for several clients. Every case is as important to me as it is to each of my clients. Since most lawyers charge the same 33.33% contingent fee, personal injury victims should hire a lawyer with experience and a proven track record.',
